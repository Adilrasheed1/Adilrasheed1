# Python Learning Journey 

This repository documents my step-by-step journey of learning **Python programming**. Each session covers specific concepts along with practice and understanding gained during that session.

## 📘 Session 1: Python Basics

In **Session 1**, I learned the foundational concepts of Python. These topics helped me understand how Python programs are written and executed.

### ✅ Topics Covered

* **Basic Syntax**
  Learned how Python code is structured, indentation rules, and how to write simple statements.

* **Data Types**
  Understood basic built-in data types such as:

  * `int`
  * `float`
  * `string`
  * `boolean`

* **Variables**
  Learned how to declare and use variables to store data.

* **Dynamic Binding**
  Understood that Python does not require explicit type declaration; the data type is decided at runtime.

* **Keywords and Identifiers**
  Learned about reserved keywords in Python and rules for naming identifiers (variables, functions, etc.).

* **User Input**
  Learned how to take input from the user using the `input()` function.

* **Literals**
  Understood different types of literals such as numeric, string, boolean, and special literals.
