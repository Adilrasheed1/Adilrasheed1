# Python Learning Journey 

This repository documents my step-by-step journey of learning **Python programming**. Each session covers specific concepts along with practice and understanding gained during that session.

## 📘 Session 1: Python Basics

In **Session 1**, I learned the foundational concepts of Python. These topics helped me understand how Python programs are written and executed.

### ✅ Topics Covered

* **Basic Syntax**
  Learned how Python code is structured, indentation rules, and how to write simple statements.

* **Data Types**
  Understood basic built-in data types such as:

  * `int`
  * `float`
  * `string`
  * `boolean`

* **Variables**
  Learned how to declare and use variables to store data.

* **Dynamic Binding**
  Understood that Python does not require explicit type declaration; the data type is decided at runtime.

* **Keywords and Identifiers**
  Learned about reserved keywords in Python and rules for naming identifiers (variables, functions, etc.).

* **User Input**
  Learned how to take input from the user using the `input()` function.

* **Literals**
  Understood different types of literals such as numeric, string, boolean, and special literals.

## 📘 Session 2: Control Flow and Program Structure

In **Session 2**, I learned how to control the flow of a Python program and organize code efficiently.

### ✅ Topics Covered

* **Operators**
  Learned different types of operators used in Python, including:

  * Arithmetic operators
  * Relational (comparison) operators
  * Logical operators
  * Assignment operators

* **If-Else Statements**
  Learned how to make decisions in a program using `if`, `elif`, and `else` conditions.

* **Loops**
  Understood how to repeat tasks using loops:

  * `for` loop
  * `while` loop
  * Use of `break` and `continue`

* **Modules**
  Learned how to use built-in Python modules and import them to reuse code and extend functionality.
